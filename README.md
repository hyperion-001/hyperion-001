# About Me

*I'm Hyperion, a narrative designer and worldbuilder. I use roleplay bots to bring my worlds to life through an immersive narrative environement.*

**Likes:**
- History
- Writing

When I'm not developing my current projects, you might find me deep in research about 18th-century medicine, designing RPG systems, or sneaking another piece of brie from the fridge.

Feel free to chat with me about worldbuilding, narrative design, AI, gothic fiction, or anything else - I'm always excited to discuss storytelling and creative development and share what I've learned with others.

*Hyperion*
